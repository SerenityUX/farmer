  <p>For the last event that I organized, we had students spend 100 hours making a game, and by the end of the 100 hours, their games were great. I began to have this concept of a scaling law: more time spent coding leads to a better project when averaged among a large group of people.</p>   
  <p>The event I am organizing now broke that law. I had students put in even more time into building their project (this time an app), but I found that students who were putting 2-3x more time on their projects were often making the same or worse quality projects compared to those of their peers putting in far less time. Why is this?</p>
  <p>A few months ago, I started going to the gym. I decided to go to SF Fitness because it seemed really good quality. It was a little more expensive than other gyms ($100/month), but the equipment felt good and it felt like a place I could grow. <i>Almost</i> every day I would go in the morning and go through the same routine. It wasn't too difficult, some lifting weights, some pulling weights, and running on the treadmill for 10 minutes. Even though I was putting in time and it felt nice doing so (like in my mind I was growing), I realized today I was making little progress.</p>
  <p>I went to the gym today that my girlfriend goes to (24 Hour Fitness) and I noticed that wow, the equipment was much older and the place was much less organized, but I started to notice the people there were putting in good practice. My girlfriend showed me how she went from 140 to 200lb on a leg machine over the past few months. When we did weights (lifting and pulling), she pointed out ways how I was using my shoulders when I should use my arms. I was doing the same routine every day, but I was not putting in good practice.</p>

  <p>I realize the same has been true for my coding practice. I've been building the same type of project for the past few years, stuck in some bad habits, and I am not really trying new things and getting better.</p>
  <p>I talked with my girlfriend about how she learned how to do gym things. She described how she had a coach that taught her how to lift properly, pull properly, and ultimately how to put in good practice that meant as she put in more time, she could measure whether she was getting meaningful results.</p>
  <p>Good practice means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>being able to measure your progress</li>
    <li>good feedback loops</li>
    <li>learning from those who are more experienced than you</li>
    <li>trying new things just a little beyond what you're comfortable with</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's not just about time, but it's about spending your time to become more capable.</p>
  <p>What does this mean for my next project?</p>
    <!-- <p>I want to try adding to Meal Pack a new voice interface. I want to try making it in a week and publishing it as an update onto the App Store.</p> -->
  <p>I'll leave that for the next journal entry when it's done (1 week from now).</p>
  <p>What does that mean for my next event and for the rest of my current event?</p>
  <p>I need to incentivize not just time but good practice. Practice where you're seeing yourself grow, seeing people engaging with the thing you made (feedback loop), learning from those just a little ahead of you and helping those behind you, and where you're encouraged to try making something you've always thought would be fun to make but never had the courage to try.</p>
