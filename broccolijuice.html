<div style="width: 100%;">
  <p>It's important to make things. It's important to make many things. What's most important though is to make things that people want. As I reflect on the past, I think many of the things I've made are like broccoli juice.</p>
  <p>The truth is, there is no market for broccoli juice. It doesn't matter how much you produce or how much work you put into it or what you do to make that juice special, people don't want it. At the same time, there's a similarly green liquid that people cannot get enough of: matcha.</p>
</div>

<div style="width: 100%;">
  <p>People want to drink matcha. They want to drink matcha every day. If there's a new matcha cafe and it fits people's sensibilities to what a matcha cafe should be, people will come. Matcha has been around for over 1,000 years. It's not something that someone came up with recently, yet people cannot get enough of it to this day.</p>
  <p>That's all to say I realize that in the past I've made things that feel a bit forced. People don't want this thing (ex. Broccoli Juice), but I am trying to force it on them by giving them reasons or features why they should like it. I think making things that people want but cannot get enough of is better than trying to create a new demand for some new desire.</p>
