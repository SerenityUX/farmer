<p>They say "you cannot teach an old dog new tricks". The "They" in question are old lazy dogs who don't want to expend the effort to learn new tricks.</p>
<p>Young people have a monopoly on being beginners. Yet, for most, to be young is a choice. </p>
<p>Pen and paper, these are the tools of any true student. Such tools are also within reach to any so-called sage.</p>

<div style="width: 100%">
<p>To change one's identity from that of an old dog sage to that of a student puppy is turning orange juice back into oranges.</p>
<p>To repair one's mind to it's original state, one must take not only the juice but the pulp it disgarded in the process. </p>
<p>To have the mind be a fruit, you must have not only the juice, the free flowly easily non-resistance work but also the bitter pulp.</p>
<p>Such a process is tedious and may take a lifetime in pursuit (spreading seeds all along the way for more fruits to blossom), but what's a better than to be an orange and remember once again what it's like to not be such an old damn dog.</p>
