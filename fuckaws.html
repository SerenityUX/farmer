  <p>It's really important to own your farming equipment. I feel that over the past year or two, I've gotten the bad habit of renting some of my critical equipment that keeps my gardening ventures alive.</p>
  <p>Over the past few days, I've migrated all of my AWS services (S3, SQL, and EC2) to a Hetzner server. AWS was initially free, but every month it increased and eventually it was costing $250/month just to run a handful of personal projects. Now, I am running all of those personal projects on a 5 dollar hetzner server with a self-hosted coolify instance.</p>

  <p>This week I am shipping Meal Pack & doing so on this self-hosted server. I feel freedom and that I am making something sustainable.</p>
  <p>Is Meal Pack the killer app that's going to change the world? No, but I'm shipping it this week and it begins the habit of shipping personal projects this summer and doing so on this new infrastructure I setup for myself.</p>
  <p>I'll share how that goes in my next update.</p>
